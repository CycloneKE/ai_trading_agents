# Algorithmic Bias Prevention System

## ✅ Comprehensive Bias Detection & Mitigation Implemented

### 🔍 Bias Detection Capabilities:

**1. Sector Bias Detection**
- Monitors distribution of trades across sectors
- Detects over/under-representation of specific industries
- Tracks performance differences by sector

**2. Market Cap Bias Detection**
- Analyzes preference for large/mid/small cap stocks
- Ensures balanced exposure across company sizes
- Prevents systematic bias toward mega-cap stocks

**3. Temporal Bias Detection**
- Identifies timing patterns in trading decisions
- Detects hour-of-day and day-of-week biases
- Monitors for systematic timing preferences

**4. Feature Bias Detection**
- Analyzes over-reliance on single indicators
- Monitors feature importance distribution
- Prevents models from becoming too dependent on one signal

### 🛡️ Bias Mitigation Strategies:

**1. Real-time Bias Correction**
- Automatically adjusts position sizes when bias detected
- Applies bias penalty factor (up to 50% reduction)
- Logs all bias corrections for transparency

**2. Fairness Constraints**
- Maximum sector concentration limits (40%)
- Minimum market cap diversity requirements (30%)
- Maximum single feature reliance threshold (60%)

**3. Adaptive Thresholds**
- Dynamic bias detection thresholds
- Self-adjusting based on market conditions
- Continuous learning from bias patterns

### 📊 Monitoring & Reporting:

**1. Daily Bias Reports**
- Comprehensive analysis of recent decisions
- Trend analysis over time
- Executive summary with key findings

**2. Real-time Alerts**
- Immediate notification when bias threshold exceeded
- Automated bias score calculation
- Proactive mitigation suggestions

**3. Historical Tracking**
- 30-day bias trend analysis
- Performance impact assessment
- Continuous improvement metrics

### 🎯 Key Benefits:

**Fairness & Ethics**
